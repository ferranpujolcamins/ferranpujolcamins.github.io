INSERT PIC OF THE PIANO

The [Kawai ES110](https://www.kawai-global.com/product/es110) digital piano comes with the [Kawai F-10H](https://www.kawai-global.com/product/f-10h/) pedal which supports [half-pedaling](https://www.sweetwater.com/insync/half-damper/)<sup>[[1.1]](#ref-kawai-es110-manual-p11)</sup>. The ES110 also supports sostenuto and soft pedals (no half-pedaling support on this ones), but there are no jack connectors for these pedals. So if you want to use sostenuto or soft you are forced to use the [Kawai F-350](https://www.kawai-global.com/product/f-350/) pedal bar.

The problem with the F-350 pedal bar is that you need to mount it on the [Kawai HML-1](https://www.kawai-global.com/product/hml-1/) stand. Not only is Kawai forcing you to buy the HML-1 stand, they are also not offering any travel friendly option for sostenuto and soft pedals.

Fortunately, there are a couple of ways to connect a regular piano pedal (or any kind of switch) to your ES100 to use it as sostenuto or soft pedal.

One solution is to take advantage of the fact that you can send sustain, soft and sostenuto pedal data through the MIDI interface of your ES110<sup>[[1.2]](#ref-kawai-es110-manual-p40)</sup>. You can use something like [MIDI Solutions Footswitch Controller](http://www.midisolutions.com/prodfsw.htm) to connect a regular pedal switch, you can use a pedal that has a built-in MIDI interface like the [Behringer FCB1010](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0089) or you can go the DIY route and build something similar to [this](https://webaudiotech.com/2017/02/20/a-piano-sustain-pedal-to-midi-usb-adapter/) and add a MIDI interface.

These solutions are not cheap, and they all require an external device that needs to be plugged to a power outlet. An alternative solution is to hack the connector that the ES110 has to connect to the Kawai F-350 pedal bar. The connector is situated under the piano.
