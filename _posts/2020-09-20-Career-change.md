On september 2020 I quit my job as iOS developer. I want to study and practice C++
and find a C++ job in the industrial sector. This is how I'm doing so far:

## Week 1 <span class="titleDate">14 - 20 Sept.</span>

**I started the week trying to build Mixxx with Nix on macOS.**
It turns out not all of Mixxx dependencies support Nix on macOS, so I started
by [making chromaprint build with Nix on macOS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/98057).
Mixxx can't still be built with Nix on macOS, but I've learnt a lot about Nix and I'll keep
working on this from time to time.

I'm one of the few Mixxx contributors with access to a Mac computer,
so **I took the task of generating the macOS bundle for the application**.
I spent the rest of the week learning about CMake and CPack.
